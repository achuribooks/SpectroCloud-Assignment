# My Learning Progression
This document is a way to keep track of my learning progress over the course of the week. I decided to create this for several reasons:
- **Learning Retention** &ndash; Notes that I can continue to refer to and that I will copy from this document prior to the PR and transfer to my own notes
- **Motivation** &ndash; I've got a long way to go, and seeing how far you've come is a great push.
- **Proof of my Commitment** &ndash; I am taking this assignment seriously and can absolutely learn whatever is necessary. Now and always. (Plus, I am ChatGPT-proofing myself.)

## What I Did Today
### Thursday, September 26
- Downloaded Git + Git Bash on my local machine; decided to steer away from GitKraken in favor of working in the terminal and learning basic commands
- Cloned the **docs-assignments** repo
- Downloaded Obsidian and began learning Markdown (as seen throughout this document, eeeeeeeyyyyy!)
- Started the deep dive into Kubernetes
- Began this document for record-keeping purposes
- Familiarized self with provided Style Guide
#### Next Steps
- Get a Docker container running in preparation for QA

### Friday, September 27
- Began breaking assignment apart so it's easier to digest, investigate, test, and edit. Had no Internet or cell service due to Hurricane Helene and roads were flooded, preventing me from going to the office, so that was all I could do for a while. 
- Went to office once water receded; stayed after work to use Internet to squeeze in some learning. Began learning at a high-level more about K8s, including clusters, master and worker nodes, kublets, the virtual network, pods, services, and ingress. Recorded these in the new "learning-notes" .md file (formerly "progression").
- Separated "progression" .md file into "learning-notes" and "log" to keep learning progress more organized.
#### Next Steps
- Revisit SpectroCloud's "Getting Started" page with Palette and use the trial version to start using kubectl to perform basic commands (not sure if this still involves setting up containers or if the trial will take care of that)

### Saturday, September 28
- Went to office, as Internet and cell service are still out for most of the county. Brought my phone and downloaded a Docker + Kubernetes course on Udemy so that I could learn offline. 
- Downloaded Docker Desktop and Visual Studio on laptop in preparation for building and running local host containers. Ran a few test commands to ensure proper setup.
- Spent a good bit of time looking at a variety of Kubernetes-related documentation and making slight revisions to existing assignment. Made the decision that the best way to assemble a reference table is based on the progression of commands and logical order.
- Watched approximately 1.5 hours of Udemy course and made lots of enhancements to notes.
- Did not get the free-trial version of Palette, as it requires a business email. Will make do with other resources.
#### Next Steps
- Continue Udemy course, enhancing my base of understanding and using what I learn to refer back to assignment and continue refinement. 

### Sunday, September 29
- Completed Kubernetes crash course (offline YouTube video, NOT Udemy). 
- Learned *lots* more about other Kubernetes components, including ConfigMap and Secret, Volume, and Deployment and Stateful Set. 
- Learned about and set up Minikube for local K8s cluster testing.
- Followed tutorial and set up first cluster by creating four YAML files: ConfigMap, Secret, and two Deployments (web application and database).
- Learned basic YAML and kubectl terminology.
- Could not test finished product, as we are still without Internet. Cell service restored, but it is limited to calls and texts.
#### Next Steps
- Bring laptop to office and test cluster.
- Use cluster QA to continue work on assignment. 
- If Internet at home is restored, download VS, Minikube, and Docker Desktop on main PC.

### Monday, September 30
- Debugged my own K8s cluster and got it to run! Could not verify output due to lack of Internet? Will have to try again at the office tomorrow.
- Worked on assignment. Identified more questions.
#### Next Steps
- Determined that Internet and cell data likely won't be restored for several more days... Will be staying at the office after work to finish a solid draft of assignment, giving myself Wednesday to polish it.
